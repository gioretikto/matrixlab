<h2>USAGE</h2>

This is a GNU/Linux utility for manipulating and performing matrix operations.
The matrix file containing the input data can be formatted in two ways:

by listing matrices seaparated by operators:

-1 2 3
0 1 3
0 4 5
*
4 0
1 2
-2 3

Execute with the following command:

./matrixlab matrix matrmax_dim

	- where matrix is the file containing the matrices
	- matrmax_dim is the dimension of the largest matrix (3 in the example above)

in the example above run: ./matrixlab matrix 3

The second method allows to initialize matrices separately by using capital letters and input the expression at the end:

A =
1 1
2 1

B=
2 1
1 1

C=
1 0
0 1

C*B*A


Note: you can use also CBA

In addition to multiplications, additions, and subtractions, matrixlab can also perform: 

Determinant Calculation
--------------------------------
To calculate the determinant format the input file thus:

det
4 -3 0
2 -1 2
1 5 7


Transpositions
-------------------

1 -2 4 
3 0 -5 
^T


Inverse of a matrix:
---------------------

4 -3 0
2 -1 2
1 5 7
^-1

Some other complex calculation matrixlab can perform

Imagine you want to solve the following system of linear equations:

2x + y + 3z = 12
4y -z = -7
5x + 8z = 34

The imput file should be formatted thus

A =
2 1 3
0 4 -1
5 0 8

B=
12
-7
34

A^-1*B

Execture with command: ./matrixlab matrix 3

<h3>Coming in the next update</h3>

We're trying to implement a new functionality in order to perform also symbolic operations, like:

evaluation of algebraic expressions

cos x sin x
cos x 5
*
1 0
0 1
=
cos x sin x
cos x 5
