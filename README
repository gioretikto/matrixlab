USAGE
------------------------------
This is a GNU/Linux utility for manipulating and performing matrix operations.
The matrix file containing the input data is thus formatted:

1 2 3
-1 2 3
0 1 3
0 4 5
*
4 0
1 2
-2 3

Execute with the following command:
	./matrilab matrix matrmax_dim

-where matrix is the file containing the matrices
-matrmax_dim is the dimension of the largest matrix (3 in the example above)

in the example above run:

	./matrixlab matrix 3
	
In addition to multiplications, additions, and subtractions, matrixlab can also perform: 

Determinant Calculation
--------------------------------

<pre>
det
4 -3 0
2 -1 2
1 5 7
</pre>

Transpositions
-------------------
<pre>
1 -2 4 
3 0 -5 
^T
</pre>

Inverse of a matrix:
---------------------

4 -3 0
2 -1 2
1 5 7
^-1

Coming in the next update
-------------------------------

For the next version I'd like the program to perform also symbolic operation, like:

-Inizialization of matrices:

A=
1 1
2 1

B=
5 6
7 8

A*B
</pre>
</li>

-Eevaluation of algebraic expressions:

<pre>
cos x sin x
cos x 5
*
1 0
0 1
=
cos x sin x
cos x 5
</pre>
</li>
</ul>
