USAGE
------------------------------
This is a GNU/Linux utility for manipulating and performing matrix operations.
The matrix file containing the input data is thus formatted:

1 2 3
-1 2 3
0 1 3
0 4 5
*
4 0
1 2
-2 3

Execute with the following command:
	./matrilab matrix matrmax_dim

-where matrix is the file containing the matrices
-matrmax_dim is the dimension of the largest matrix (3 in the example above)

in the example above run:

	./matrixlab matrix 3

Matrix Determinant Calculation
--------------------------------
To calculate the determinant format the input file thus:

det
4 -3 0
2 -1 2
1 5 7

CONTRIBUTIONS:

For the next version I'd like to perform also symbolic operation of the kind:

cos x sin x
cos x 5
*
1 0
0 1
=
cos x sin x
cos x 5

and also assigment such as:

A=
1 1
2 1

B=
5 6
7 8

A*B
