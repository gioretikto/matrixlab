USAGE
------------------------------
This is a GNU/Linux utility for manipulating and performing matrix operations.
The matrix file containing the input data is thus formatted:


-1 2 3
0 1 3
0 4 5
*
4 0
1 2
-2 3

Execute with the following command:
	./matrixlab matrix matrmax_dim

-where matrix is the file containing the matrices
-matrmax_dim is the dimension of the largest matrix (3 in the example above)

in the example above run:

	./matrixlab matrix 3

or you can initialize matrices separately by using capital letters and input the expression at the end, thus:

A =
1 1
2 1

B=
2 1
1 1

C=
1 0
0 1

C*B*A
	
In addition to multiplications, additions, and subtractions, matrixlab can also perform: 

Determinant Calculation
--------------------------------
To calculate the determinant format the input file thus:

det
4 -3 0
2 -1 2
1 5 7

Transpositions
-------------------

1 -2 4 
3 0 -5 
^T


Inverse of a matrix:
---------------------


4 -3 0
2 -1 2
1 5 7
^-1

Some other complex calculation matrixlab can perform
-------------------------------------------------
2
*
5 6 7
8 9 8
1 2 3
det
1 0 0
0 1 0
0 0 1
+
1 1 1
1 1 1
1 1 1

Execture command: ./matrixlab matrix 3

Coming in the next update
******************************************************
We're trying to implement a new functionality in order to perform also symbolic operations, like:

evaluation of algebraic expressions

cos x sin x
cos x 5
*
1 0
0 1
=
cos x sin x
cos x 5
